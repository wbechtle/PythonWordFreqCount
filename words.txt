the
history
just
cutting
the
cultural
importance
of
transforming
meaningful
memories
into
a
permanent
way
of
conserving
those
memories
opportunity
to
learn
something
that
offered
by
the
college
learning
the
process
and
history
of
papermaking
participating
the
workshop
the
history
making
paper
I
like
the
art
work
the
most
nothing
making
the
paper
from
the
mulch
if
puts
a
lot
of
personal
work
into
the
individual
process
which
makes
each
sheet
personal
and
one
of
a
kind
this
activity
was
great
because
it
connected
the
military
literacy
history
and
artistic
culture
all
in
one
day
the
history
perspective
and
sense
of
connection
it
has
to
peoples
events
expressed
in
art
how
it
connect
to
veterans
helping
veterans
deal
with
the
problems
that
arise
after
going
and
fighting
in
wars
the
history
behind
making
the
paper
knowing
these
programs
are
available
the
most
valuable
aspect
was
making
the
paper
the
step
by
step
of
the
process
seeing
step
by
step
process
to
learn
a
new
art
making
the
paper
cutting
the
uniform
people
might
of
survived
in
learning
how
to
make
paper
the
whole
thing
learning
about
past
and
present
the
clothes
in
general
that
was
used
to
make
the
paper
beign
able
to
see
history
happen
in
real
time
it
was
relevant
to
what
I
am
learning
now
in
ancient
history
about
literacy
an
insightful
look
into
the
process
they
they
go
to
other
places
and
use
this
as
therapy
for
veterans
the
fact
aht
they
help
others
is
amazing
learning
how
to
make
paper
to
old
fashioned
way
knowing
they
still
make
paper
by
hand
learning
a
part
of
history
I
did
not
know
because
I
got
here
so
late
I
did
not
really
get
the
whole
thing
I
took
this
as
same
kind
of
recycling
thing
it
was
really
cool
being
able
to
actually
create
and
learn
each
individual
part
to
creating
the
education
the
most
valuable
aspect
was
the
program
was
founded
and
it
is
ability
to
help
veterans
learn
new
about
paper
the
stories
behind
the
paper
knowing
that
military
uniforms
can
come
to
use
after
the
person
services
learning
to
make
things
and
deal
with
your
past
in
a
healthy
way
outlet
for
feelings
and
history
lesson
being
able
to
learn
something
new
and
rare
learning
an
old
art
how
interesting
it
was
the
recovery
of
the
materials
all
of
it
just
learn
the
process
and
getting
to
participate
learning
about
the
history
of
paper
interacting
with
my
students
outside
the
classroom
I
think
therapy
for
veterans
is
good
working
with
others
source
of
paper
remember
all
the
sacrifices
that
the
military
wore
with
the
uniform
on
how
people
convert
something
old
for
something
new
and
beautiful
making
paper
learn
new
thing
the
important
thing
that
I
think
the
peace
and
no
more
wars
I
meet
new
nice
people
learned
new
information
learned
the
history
of
paper
the
importance
of
peach
all
over
the
world
my
opinion
is
really
good
because
this
process
help
people
forget
the
trauma
and
create
new
thing
know
the
process
the
paper
using
the
uniforms
with
means
important
introduction
it
is
very
good
to
learn
new
things
history
beating
a
piece
of
paper
in
the
machine
for
making
it
deserved
remember
like
qualities
that
the
military
make
with
the
uniform
on
for
me
it
was
seeing
the
art
of
the
combat
paper
seeing
how
veterans
came
together
and
helped
people
in
the
community
come
together
as
well
and
share
in
the
paper
making
process
having
two
hands
on
experience
while
someone
spoke
about
why
we
were
doing
it
learning
how
to
make
paper
my
name
on
it
the
hands
on
experience
in
making
paper
and
interaction
with
people
we
turned
apiece
of
clothing
with
its
own
history
and
made
it
into
something
that
can
be
reused
and
given
new
meaning
and
purpose
the
learning
of
how
the
process
progresses
from
start
to
finish
learning
of
the
process
the
veterans
have
gone
through
the
most
valuable
aspect
of
this
even
was
its
new
ways
to
creativity
learning
about
the
process
and
hearing
individual
stories
learning
the
history
getting
to
keep
the
piece
of
paper
made
myself
the
use
of
veterans
uniforms
to
reuse
and
recycle
perhaps
for
veterans
remembering
and
embracing
their
past
the
historical
information
on
paper
was
great
making
the
paper
and
the
history
the
historical
infor
about
paper
I
learn
making
the
paper
to
some
probably
the
whole
writing
history
par
to
me
I
find
a
lot
of
this
valuable
easy
A
the
most
valuable
aspect
of
this
event
is
that
it
informs
other
people
about
alternatives
to
paper
making
aside
from
trees
which
are
disappearing
fast
understanding
the
significance
of
the
organization
and
its
purpose
it
was
a
great
experience
and
history
behind
making
paper
out
of
clothing
seeing
a
part
being
done
by
hand
since
everything
is
by
robot
fun
learning
knowing
that
veterans
are
getting
the
opportunity
to
relet
their
thoughts
and
emotions
the
backgroun
on
why
this
is
meaningful
the
in
depth
analysis
of
why
they
reuse
military
uniforms
to
make
paper
also
recycling
is
important
learning
how
to
take
something
sacred
that
usually
is
wasted
and
making
something
out
of
it
the
people
and
the
minds
they
have
and
the
hearts
they
have
for
this
the
hands
on
experience
of
each
step
of
the
process
teaching
you
a
new
way
to
move
on
it
was
hands
on
there
is
always
something
more
personal
when
you
can
create
something
with
your
hands
the
process
and
philosophy
taking
memories
of
something
to
create
new
memories
the
making
of
paper
and
how
it
is
processed
turning
memories
into
creatvity
the
most
valuable
aspect
was
taking
memories
that
some
one
and
turned
it
into
something
that
could
display
those
memories
or
turned
into
something
else
the
tiem
spent
talking
about
how
much
uniforms
mean
to
their
donators
the
learning
and
the
honoring
uniforms
does
not
mean
war
or
separation
or
sadness
it
can
be
made
to
something
beautiful
and
worthwhile
the
most
valuable
aspect
of
this
even
was
cutting
up
the
uniforms
because
they
are
being
used
for
a
good
purpose
the
hands
on
experience
making
paper
from
the
clothes
of
military
veterans
learning
about
their
story
and
seeing
the
passion
in
their
eyes
learning
that
paper
have
stories
of
these
uniforms
it
gives
veterans
a
chance
to
express
themselves
and
get
stuff
off
their
chest
free
paper
actually
making
the
paper
with
the
buckets
of
pulp
using
something
was
meaning
to
us
an
dturning
it
into
something
create
meaning
for
others
valuable
aspect
of
event
was
the
learning
and
the
learning
process
incredible
being
able
to
particpate

with
classmates
that
it
will
be
an
memory
I
can
cherish

the
paper
